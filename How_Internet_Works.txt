Internet is a wire buried in the ground.
- computer connected to wire can communicate

- every computer has unique IP address(internet protocol) address
  -these computers are servers -> connected directly to the internet


home computers are "clients" that connect through an internet service provider(ISP)

information is sent in small chucks called packets
  - packets are reassebled into their original form at destination

routers -> direct packets around the internet
  - wrapping analogy

modem -> allows connection to the telephone infrastructure
  - packets go from modem to ISP's special routers

domain names eg. google are aliases for IP addresses

Internet is thus an infrastructure. different from what a Web is

,Google Chrome,Opera, Microsoft Internet Explorer or Edge. These are often
just called "pages."

website = A collection of web pages which are grouped together and usually 
connected together in various ways. often called a web site 0r simply site

web server=  A compter that hosts a website on the internet

search engine= web service that helps you find other web pages


HTTP = hypertext transfer protocol

if web address starts with file:// followed by path to local file then it
will be displayed in the browser.
http:// shows receiving via http

ro run simple server:
python3 -m http.server
